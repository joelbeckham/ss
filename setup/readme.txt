This project was originally developed on Ubuntu 13.10. There is little reason that this won't work on other variants of Linux, although Ubuntu is recommended due to the font-rendering improvements made by the Ubuntu team.

Since Ubuntu is the "best" platform for this type of WebKit based X-renderer I have included some from-scratch instructions for anyone who might have trouble or want to build a VM to host this service.
