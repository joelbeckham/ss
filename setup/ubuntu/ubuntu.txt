Step by step instructions to building an environment and installing ss:

$ sudo apt-get install xvfb apache2 git ttf-mscorefonts-installer fontconfig libapache2-mod-wsgi
$ sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-django python-pip python-sip python-qt4

Sadly the ms fonts provided within the mscorefonts lacks tahoma, so that needs to be manually copied from somewhere,
there are 2 files (tahomabd.ttf, tahoma.ttf) that need to be copied to: /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts

Copy the included xvfb init.d script to /etc/init.d, ensure it is marked executable

Install the script into proper run levels
$ sudo update-rc.d xvfb defaults 50 50

Install the backend web scraping library that wraps webkit:
$ sudo pip install webscraping

Copy the included hostname.conf file to /etc/apache2/sites-available - make sure to rename the file to your hostname, once
the file is in place edit the file and replace all references to "hostname" with your own hostname.

Once the configuration file is in place run the following:
$ sudo a2ensite hostname.conf

Copy the included mpm_prefork.conf file to /etc/apache2/mods-available. Once the file is in place run the following:
$ sudo a2dismod mpm_event
$ sudo a2enmod mpm_prefork

From here the application needs to be dropped in the appropriate /var/www/hostname directory, either through tar ball or direct checkout from git (preferred):
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/kamelkev/ss.git /var/www/hostname

Finally log file ownership needs to be adjusted:
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/hostname/logs/mylog.log  /var/www/hostname/logs/django_request.log
